# ErlangDemo

This code was some stuff I slapped together to illustrate basic Erlang syntax, specifically to highlight it's basic concurrency features. Erlang's concurrency is a really interesting approach to the problem, and I like how it elegantly resolves problems of shared state- it doesn't exist. There are no variables, etc.

This is mostly just sample files, just to demonstrate basic Erlang concepts. The lack of documentation is because I'm planning to talk over them as we work.
